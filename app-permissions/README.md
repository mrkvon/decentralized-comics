# App Permissions

My take on how we can make sure a Solid app can only do what you allow it to do. This is a fiction, not a part of any specification.

AFAIK the closest we have to this is [Solid Application Interoperability (SAI)](https://solid.github.io/data-interoperability-panel/specification/).
