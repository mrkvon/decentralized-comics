## Future of this work

I'm passionate about decentralized social internet, and I enjoy drawing. I may occasionally publish new works on topics related to decentralized internet. If you enjoy this, if you've learnt something from it, that's the biggest motivation for me to continue.

I draw when I have access to a digital drawing pad/tablet. I'm grateful to [Helsinki Metropolitan Area Libraries](https://helmet.finna.fi/?lng=en-gb) for providing [infrastructure for digital drawing](https://varaamo.hel.fi/en/reservation-unit/262).

If you happen to have a drawing tablet laying around, you can donate it to me (Europe).
